<!--
A block-level tag creates a block (or "box") of content that typically starts on a new line and takes up the full width of its parent container.

Key Features of Block-Level Tags:
-Default Layout: They stack vertically by default.
-Full Width: By default, they stretch to fit the width of their container.
-Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <table>, etc
